# College Explorer
College Explorer is a portal for Indonesian high school graduates which aims to cater to all their needs - be it looking for a college, finding productive skills to learn over the break, or speaking to prospective seniors about their dream colleges. 
We connect these students with campus ambassadors from colleges across Indonesia. These campus ambassadors provide complete information regarding their colleges and clear any doubts students may have.

## Motivation
We wanted to create a medium through which we could connect high school graduates with prospective seniors at the colleges they aim to study in. 
It is always better to interact with students currently studying in these colleges rather than trying to know everything about the college through their websites. College Explorer aims to bridge this gap.

## Tech Stack
1. Flask
2. SQLite
3. HTML/CSS
4. Bootstrap

## Future Scope
College Explorer can be expanded to include colleges not just in Indonesia, but globally. This would create a worldwide community of college students and high school undergraduates looking to learn more about their dream colleges.
